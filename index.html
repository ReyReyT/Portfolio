				<h3> About me. </h3>
			<p>
My name is Thomas Rey. I currently live in the Cambridge area. I am keen on working within the gaming industry. I have relevant experience in this sector I have previously studied at Cambridge Regional College doing a level 3 games development and design, during my time there I did six months worth of work experience, finally I worked for PlayFusion in Cambridge for a year. 
</p><p>
Ive always enjoyed working in teams whether it be in sports when I was younger, or in more recent years when it comes to games or at work. Despite loving working in teams I also am very strong at working independently. My previous experience at PlayFusion taught a lot of useful skills whether it be QA related or events related. Recently I have completed a coding course working with css, HTML and JS mainly as well as Xcode.

      <h2>Games</h2>

	  <p>
	  I have experience working in the games industry and I am always looking to build on my skills within this area. Most of my experience lies in the QA area, I did six months full time work in QA for them. My experience playing games goes all the back to when I was a young child, I spent a lot of my childhood playing games, starting on the original PlayStation and the Sega Mega Drive. As newer consoles were coming out I was lucky to get them at home these include: Xbox, PlayStation 2, Xbox 360, Wii and more. I now play all my games on my PC or my PlayStation 4, I started playing games on a desktop in 2012. This is when I really started to understand games and gaming in general, I think this due to the accessibility of the internet and information on a PC.

		<h4> Half Hearted Lee. </h4>
		<p2>
		Is the main project I worked on during my time at college. This game was made my friend and I, although the art was done by another member of our course. The idea for our game was to make a puzzle platformer, where the user would play as the main protagonist Lee. The problem is Lee has been cut in half so the aim of the game is to reunite both of Lee's halves. We were going to have multiple ways of doing this towards the end of the game, he could become fully angelic, fully evil or the final option would be to become human again. As the name suggests he was half heartedly trying to reconnect his two halves as one was evil and the other was good, because he was cut in half he had to hop everywhere which was tiring for him, he wanted to reconnect to complete himself again, but he did not want the evil half of himself back so he would complete his mission half heartedly.
